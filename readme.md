Hello! This is my project made for my CIM 103 class. 
This class is one that focuses on Front-End Development and website interfaces.
This project asks for students to pick a website that they find interesting and well done and to try and replicate the website's UI.
My name is Nadia Rodriguez and I made this on March 06, 2024. 
I chose YouTube because I thought it would be an interesting challenge at the time and that the individual video boxes would be challenging to do.
